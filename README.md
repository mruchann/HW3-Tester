An updated version of the assistant's tester.

### Usage

1.	Extract your `hw3.tar.gz` file.
2.	Place your submission code into the project folder.
3.	When prompted, move the files into the `Submission` folder.

You are free to make changes to the code inside the `Submission` folder after the first run. The tester will automatically create a new tarball for the grader with each run. This allows you to see how your modifications impact your grade.

### Fairness

I know everyone needs points, but please only correct your code, not add stuff to get 100%.
